\begin{alltt}
main()
	inputs: none
	process: Called when the program is run; executes make_window, show,
		loadImages, and loadLevel.
	outputs: none

make_window()
	imputs: none
	process: FLTK-generated function, creates the window for our program
	outputs: pointer to Fl_Double_Window (the window it made)

handle()
	inputs: The code for the event that is being handled
	process: If the event was a keypress, pass it into determineKeyPressed.
	outputs: Used by FLTK only

loadImages()
	inputs: none
	process: Calls loadBackgrounds, loadArrowKeys, and loadGifs.
	outputs: none
\end{alltt}

\clearpage

\begin{alltt}
loadBackgrounds()
	inputs: none
	process: Sets background Fl image variables to images on the local
		machine.
	outputs: none

loadArrowKeys()
	inputs: none
	process: Sets arrow key Fl image variables to images on the local
		machine.
	outputs: none

loadGifs()
	inputs: none
	process: Sets dancer GIF Fl image variables to images on the local
		machine.
	outputs: none

loadLevel(int)
	inputs: The number of the level to load (starting at 0)
	process: Changes the background and dancer images to those corresponding
		to the level we are loading.
	outputs: none
\end{alltt}

\begin{alltt}
setNewTimer()
	inputs: none
	process: Calls popupRandomArrow, and creates a new timeout for 
		timerExpire.
	outputs: none

timerExpire()
	inputs: none
	process: Calls correctKeyPressed to see if the player had pressed the 
		right key; if not then end the game, if so then call setNewTimer.
	outputs: none

correctKeyPressed()
	inputs: none
	process: Checks bCorrectKeyPressed and returns it.
	outputs: returns true if the player had pressed the key within the 
		specified amount of time.

determineKeyPressed(int)
	inputs: The code of the key that was pressed
	process: Takes the input code and compares it to the code of the key 
		that should have been pressed; if they match, set a global bool
		bCorrectKeyPressed to true.

popupRandomArrow()
	inputs: none
	process: Randomly picks an arrow key and displays it on the screen.
	outputs: none
