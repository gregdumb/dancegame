SETUP:

Step 1: Install Git on the VM by going to the 
        software thing and searching for "Git"

Step 2: Make sure the git install worked, type
        "git" into the terminal.  You should 
        see a list of available commands.

Step 3: Set up git.  You need to give it your 
        name and email before it lets you do 
        anything.  Follow the "setting up git" 
        section here: https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/

Step 4: Type "git clone https://github.com/gregdumb/dancegame.git"
        into the terminal.  This will make a 
        new folder called "dancegame" and put 
        what I've already done into it.  Yay!

Now change something.  Maybe add a "<yourname> here!" in the Readme.txt, for testing purposes.

TO SAVE YOUR CHANGES TO THE REPOSITORY:

Step 1. When you're done changing something, 
        type "git add FILENAME".  In this 
        case, it would be "git add Readme.txt".  
        (To upload all files in the folder, 
        type "git add ./")

Step 2. Enter "git commit -m "Your message 
        here".  The message is required.

Step 3. Enter "git push".  You will be asked 
        to enter your github username and 
        password.  If it says something like 
        "all files up to date" then you did 
        something wrong.  It should say something 
        like "pushed readme.txt".

To confirm that your commit worked, go to the 
github page for our project (https://github.com/gregdumb/dancegame)
and click on the Readme.txt.  You should see 
the new line you added!  If you don't see your 
changes, go through the steps again: git add, 
git commit, and git push.
