SETUP:
Step 1: Install Git on the VM by going to the software thing and searching for "Git"
Step 2: Make sure the git install worked, type "git" into the terminal.  You should see a list of available commands.
Step 3: Set up git.  You need to give it your name and email before it lets you do anything.  Follow the "setting up git" section here: https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/
Step 4: Type "git clone https://github.com/gregdumb/dancegame.git" into the terminal.  This will make a new folder called "dancegame" and put what I've already done into it.  Yay!

Now change something.  Maybe add a "<yourname> here!" in the Readme.txt, for testing purposes.

When you're done changing something, type "git add Readme.txt".  (To upload all files in the folder, "type git add ./")
Then enter "git commit -m "Your message here".  The message is required.
THEN enter "git push".  You will be asked to enter your github username and password.  If it says something like "zero stuff changed" then you did something wrong.

To confirm that your commit worked, go to the github page for our project (https://github.com/gregdumb/dancegame) and click on the Readme.txt.  You should see the new line you added!
